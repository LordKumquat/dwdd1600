        <p><strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> is a game in which you play with your friends exploring rich worlds, discovering unique strategies, and developing your skills. Each player starts the game with 20 life. Get your opponent's 20 life points down to 0 and you win the game.<br><br>Here you'll find <em>everything</em> you need to know to get into Magic: The Gathering.</p>
            <p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering</a> is the trading card game that kicked off that entire genre. From its first set in 1993, it’s offered gripping tactical gameplay, near-infinite deckbuilding opportunities, and some of the best art and worldbuilding in tabletop gaming. In 2019, Wizards of the Coast launched Magic: The Gathering Arena, a user-friendly, frequently-updated way to play Magic on digital devices. Since then, Arena has gone on to become one of the biggest aspects of Magic. It was the home of the game during the pandemic, exclusive sets are made specifically for it that never see print, and it’s even supplanted tabletop as the go-to place to play Magic’s primary format, Standard. The way that Magic is played is heavily influenced by the <a href="howtoplay.html#colors">color</a> you choose. </p>
            
            <h2>What makes Magic: The Gathering so difficult?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Magic has a steep learning curve initially, and even once that hump is cleared, the learning curve continues as a steady incline.</li>
                    <li>There is a lot of Magic-vocabulary that required to be learned for even the most basic rules.</li>
                    <li> In 2019, a bunch of computer scientists put their heads together, and figured out that Magic: The Gathering was officially the most complicated game, ever.</li>
                    <li>Even though Chess and magic are both very deep and intricate games, Magic is harder to learn, deeper, and more complex.</li>
