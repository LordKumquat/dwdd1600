            <ol>
                <li><em>Card Name</em><br>You can only have up to four cards of the same name in a single deck, except for Basic Lands, which are unlimited.</li>
                <li><em>Mana Cost</em><br>Mana is used to cast spells. To cast a spell, you'll pay the colored mana plus additional mana of any color, for a total of the mana cost.</li>
                <li><em>Type</em><br>Every card in Magic has a typre, such as Land, Creature, Artifact, Enchantment, Planeswalker, Instant, and Sorcery.</li>
                <li><em>Set Symbol</em><br>The color of this symbol indicates rarity - black-and-white is common, silver is uncommon, gold is rare, and orange-gold is mythic rare (the rarest you can get).</li>
                <li><em>Text Box</em><br>This is the large box underneath the picture is the box that contains the important information about what the card actually does.</li>
                <li><em>Power/Toughness</em><br>This is the section of a card that exists only for creature spells and gives you the general size of the creature in question. These numbers are found in the bottom right corner of the card.</li>
